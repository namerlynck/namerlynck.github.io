        <h4>Cycling</h4>
    <article>
        <p>My cycling journey started in 2020 during lockdown. My brother
            and dad were already cycling way before 2020. So during lockdown I went on my first rides. Immediately fell in
            love. At the time I was still playing football. After the 2022 football season I decided to quit and
            do cycling instead. I made this decision because I liked cycling more. The 2023 road cycling season was my
            first. During this season I learned the basics of racing but my level wasn't good enough to compete in
            UCI races. In the smaller local races I could score a place in the top 20 if things went right.</p>
        <h4>Season 2024</h4>
        <p>Now onto the next season. During the winter I made a massive progression with my level. Now I was able
        to "compete" in the UCI races. The highlight of my UCI adventures was a 15th place in the classic region sud
        in France. Back to Belgium were I also rode to the 22nd place in the legendary "Ronde Van Vlaanderen".
        Later in the season I went on to get nice results in national races. It started with a 12th place in de
        "Limburgse Pijl". After that race I had a stellar performance at the "Tryptique Ardennais".</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stage 1: 19th</li>
            <li>Stage 2: 7th</li>
            <li>Stage 3: 3rd</li>
            <li>GC: 6th</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After that I went on vacation where I took some rest and recovered. Second day back from vacation
        there is a race in the "Beker van België" in Angreau where I crash in the 2nd lap (out of 10 laps). I had
        to ride 100km on my spare bike. After not feeling great the whole race I found energy from deep within.
        I rode to the front and attacked on the second to last time of the climb. Only 2 others could follow.
        Now in trio we rode to the breakaway that was up the rode. We caught them just before the finish. It was
        an uphill finish and I was pretty cooked of the chase so I only finished 8th but still a good result.
        In the final race of the "Beker van België" I was in the break for 80km and still finished in the first
        group. A very strong race if i say so myself. Then the final UCI race of the year. "La Philippe Giblert".
        In the end I became 34th out of 150 which isn't good but not bad either on that level. Now the season is over.</p>
        <p>2025 will be my first year in the U23 category. I'm hoping everything will go well.</p>
